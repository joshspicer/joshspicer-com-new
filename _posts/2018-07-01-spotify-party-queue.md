> Spotify public queue is what you'll find LIVE over **[here]({{site.url}}/queue)** - add a song or two!

<h2>Intro</h2>

I love discovering new music.
<br><br>
Whether that be through Spotify's daily playlists, or through suggestions from a friend,  I really enjoy
discovering, diving into, and experiencing new music.
<br><br>
I lied a little...songs don't directly get added to my queue, instead they get added to a [playlist called "Josh's Public Queue"](https://open.spotify.com/user/joshspicer37/playlist/0OBq0h6EjCmaPXjeCB4IlM?si=6ZeWyAiRR0u51UJK-7Hb_g). You can follow and listen to that
playlist, and of course add song recommendations through this site.
<br><br>
I went on a few 5-6 hour road trips this summer and noticed how annoying it is for passengers to queue songs.  Next road trip, I will
certainly be pointing my passengers to this blog post (and watch the queue chaos ensue).

<h2>Guide</h2>

**NOTE**: This guide is an extension of my last post on Spotify "now playing" with AWS Lambda.
<br><br>
Make sure you first go through the **[Spotify "now playing" post]({{site.url}}/spotify-now-playing)**. That post will
give you the background necessary in getting a Spotify client ID, as well as setting up AWS DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda.

(The rest of the writeup will arrive shortly. [Add a song or two]({{site.url}}/queue) in the meantime....)
