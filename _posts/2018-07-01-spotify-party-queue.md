<h2>Intro</h2>

I love discovering new music.
<br><br>
Whether that be through Spotify's daily playlists, or through suggestions from a friend,  I really enjoy
discovering, diving into, and experiencing new music.
<br><br>
I've had this idea for a while - how can I make it dead-simple to add songs to a queue. With this post, i've taken it one
step further, letting *anyone* add to my queue.
<br><br>
Well ok...not *exactly* my queue. Song get added instead to a [playlist called "Josh's Public Queue"](https://open.spotify.com/user/joshspicer37/playlist/0OBq0h6EjCmaPXjeCB4IlM?si=6ZeWyAiRR0u51UJK-7Hb_g). You can follow and listen to that
playlist, and of course add song recommendations through this site.

<h2>Guide</h2>

Make sure you first go through the **[Spotify "now playing" post]({{site.url}}/spotify-now-playing)**. That post will
give you the background necessary in getting a Spotify client ID, as well as setting up AWS DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda.
This guide is an extension of that post.

(The rest of the writeup will arrive shortly. [Add a song or two]({{site.url}}/queue) in the meantime....)
