**NOTE**: This guide is an extension of my last post on Spotify "now playing" with AWS Lambda.

**Don't read any further** until you've gone through the **[Spotify "now playing" post]({{site.url}}/spotify-now-playing)**. That post will
give you the background necessary in getting a Spotify client ID, as well as setting up AWS DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda.

(lucky right now there *isn't* anything further...)
