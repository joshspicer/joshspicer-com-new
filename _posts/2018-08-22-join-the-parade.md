> Parade is an events discovery app I co-founded and am actively developing!
> Check out **[https://parade.events/](https://parade.events/)** for our progress and for details!

After months of planning and development, our team is _very_ excited to officially **[launch on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parade-events/id1380171412?ls=1&mt=8)**! Northeastern students can hop onto the app
and start exploring today!

You may be thinking...what is Parade? In anticipation of your confusion, I wrote a (comprehensive) [welcome guide](https://parade.events/blog/welcome-guide) over on the Parade blog. This post details the core Parade features and design decisions that went into the app.

I've made multiple posts on the technical process behind developing a React Native application. I have many more planned, as well as
more dev-ops oriented posts involving our API server (now hosted as an AWS Lambda function). I'm also writing a design post with sketches and
ideas from our very first Parade meetings.

- Lambda & GraphQL (coming soon)
- [Push Notifications]({{site.url}}/parade-push-notifications)
- Parade Design Evolution over 12 Months (coming soon)

Also check out our [GitHub page](https://github.com/parade-events/) which hosts a few of our public repos. Most notably is the [Parade website](https://github.com/parade-events/parade-events.github.io) that I wrote, and is live at [https://parade.events/](https://parade.events/).
Our app's main repo and our server code is private, although code snippets can be made available upon request.
