> As of June 2018, Colorful Motivation has 300+ users!

Replace your (boring and white) new tab page on Chrome with (fun and colorful) motivation. This extension displays your current age, and generates a background color based on that age.

The hex color is generated from the 2nd through 7th decimal places (the beginning doesn't change much, but the least significant number changes ~5 seconds).

Click on the birthday in the bottom-left corner to modify current settings.  You can see the current hex color being used in the bottom right corner.

Based off of the concept put forth in an older Chrome extension "Motivation" by maccman.
