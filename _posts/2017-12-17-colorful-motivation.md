> As of June 2018, Colorful Motivation has 300+ users on the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorful-motivation-new-t/mebfadffaiadgfhoieipinanpcmklhil)!

Replace your (boring and white) new tab page on Chrome with (fun and colorful) motivation. This extension displays your current age, and generates a background color based on that age.

The hex color is generated from the 2nd through 7th decimal places (the beginning doesn't change much, but the least significant number changes ~5 seconds). This provides a gradual change in color that is derived directly from your age.

Clicking on the birthday in the bottom-left corner allows a user to modify current settings.  The current hex color being used is displayed in the bottom-right corner.

You can play with the webpage version I created **[here]({{site.url}}/age)** before porting it to a Chrome extension.
<br><br>
Based off of the concept put forth in an older Chrome extension "Motivation" by [maccman](http://github.com/maccman).
